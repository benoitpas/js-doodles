* hail-storm is deployed [here](https://benoitpas.github.io/hail-storm.html)

* map is deployed [here](https://benoitpas.github.io/map.html). This is to select [*.gpx files](https://hikingguy.com/how-to-hike/what-is-a-gpx-file/) and display them on a map. By loading multiple files describing routes in the same aera, it is possible to see how much the routes overlap.
